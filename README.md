 Diabetes Prediction with SVM
This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Steps:
Load and preprocess data (StandardScaler)

Train/test split (80/20)

Train two SVM models: linear and rbf

Evaluate using classification_report and cross_val_score

Tune hyperparameters (GridSearchCV)

Visualize decision boundaries using PCA (2D)

ðŸ“Š Results:
Printed classification reports for both kernels

Cross-validation accuracy for RBF SVM

Best C and gamma from grid search

2D plot of SVM decision boundary using PCA
